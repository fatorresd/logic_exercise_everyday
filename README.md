# Daily Logic Challenge

Welcome to my **Daily Logic Challenge** repository! ðŸš€

## What is this?

This repository is a personal project where I commit to solving **one logic challenge every day**. The goal is to improve my problem-solving skills, strengthen my understanding of algorithms and data structures, and become a better programmer overall.

Each day, I tackle a new problem, write the solution in Python (or another language), and document my thought process. Feel free to explore the challenges and solutions!

## Why am I doing this?

- **Consistency**: By solving one problem every day, I build a habit of continuous learning and improvement.
- **Skill Development**: Logic challenges help me sharpen my coding skills and think critically.
- **Documentation**: Writing clear explanations helps me reinforce my understanding and share my knowledge with others.

## How to Navigate This Repository

- Each day's challenge is stored in its own folder, named with the date and a brief description of the problem.
- Inside each folder, you'll find:
  - The problem statement.
  - My solution code.
  - A brief explanation of my approach.

## Challenges

Here are the challenges I've solved so far:

- **[Day 1: Best Time to Buy and Sell](best_time_to_buy_and_sell.py)** - Find the best time to buy and sell a stock to maximize profit.
- **[Day 2: Jump Game](jump_game.py)** - Determine if you can reach the last index of an array using jumps.
- **[Day 2: Number of Substrings Containing All Three Characters](number_of_substrings_containing_all_three_characters.py)** - Count the number of substrings containing all three characters ('a', 'b', and 'c').
- **[Day 3: Add Two Numbers](add_two_numbers.py)** - Create a function that receives a list of integers and returns the maximum difference between two elements, under these conditions:
- **[Day 3: Add Two Numbers with 2 arrays](add_two_numbers_arrays.py)** - You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
- *(More to come!)*
